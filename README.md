# Semicolon.js â€” a more secure and reliable Vapor.js

Semicolon.js is a much more secure, stable and reliable alternative to 
<a href="http://vaporjs.com/">Vapor.js</a>.

## Usage
```html
<script src="semicolon.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, inline the whole code, like this:

```html
<script>;;;</script>
```

Here's a diagram of how the stableness and securityness is achieved:

### Thanks

Thanks to @alloy for pointing out the inherent code security and 
interoperability problems with Vapor.js; and suggesting to
leverage the semicolon solution to address the underlying issues.
