# Semicolon.js â€” a more secure and reliable Vapor.js

Semicolon.js is a much more secure, stable and reliable alternative to 
<a href="http://vaporjs.com/">Vapor.js</a>.


## Build:

After much discussion, it became clear that to support this library far into the
future, we would need to abstract the requirements into its own language, which
can be compiled down to different languages.

Currently the compiler generates valid code for JavaScript and CoffeeScript, but
could easily be extended to support additional languages.

The compiler can be build with:

```
make
```

It produces the `semiscriptc` tool, which can then be used to compile SemiScript
source. These source files typically have the `.semi` extension.

JavaScript:

```
./semiscriptc -js semicolon.semi
;
```

CoffeeScript:

```
./semiscriptc -cs semicolon.semi

```

Beatiful.

Finally, a convenience task is available to produce products for both JavaScript
_and_ CoffeeScript:

```
make distbuild
```


## Usage: 
```html
<script src="semicolon.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, inline the whole code, like this:

```html
<script>;</script>
```

### Thanks

Thanks to @alloy for pointing out the inherent code security and 
interoperability problems with Vapor.js; and suggesting to
leverage the semicolon solution to address the underlying issues.
